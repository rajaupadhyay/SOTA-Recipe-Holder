# SOTA-Recipe-Holder
This project involved working with NTT Japan to deploy a robot called SOTA in kitchens as a cooking assistant. 
We used the Spoonacular API to provide the user with requested recipes or to provide the user recipes they can cook with the current ingredients they have. 
exe.java is the main file.
